# Efficient Redidual Dense Block Search

get ready:
    mkdir Data parameters retrainedModel

    Download Data from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hd-C5iM11eHGcp6c-fY4fZC9-BoAHvEP?usp=sharing
    Extract the zip file
    Replace this expracted data with the Data folder we made

to evlove:
    python main.py -t evlove

    Some of the best models will be saved in parameters folder during evolution.
    Final Elites will be saved in a file named Elites.csv
    From the file Elites.csv and folder parameters good models can be selected and retrained

to train or retrain:
    python main.py -t train -s <sequence>

to test:
    python main.py -t test -s <sequence> -d <dataset>

datasets options : [div2k, b100, set5, set14, urban100]

sequence example : ssgcccgscggs
sequence consists s, g, and c representing SRDB, GRDB and CRDB respectively.
Length of the sequence must be >= 4 and <= 21.
